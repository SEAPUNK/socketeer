WELCOME TO THE SOCKETEER PROJECT LAYOUT FILE

BECAUSE NOBODY CAN EVER AGREE ON WHAT MODULE EXPORT
TO USE, HOW TO REQUIRE FILES, YADDA YADDA YADDA,
I AM MORE OR LESS FORCED TO HAVE A CUSTOM BUILD SYSTEM
THAT (ALMOST) SATISFIES ALL OF THE USERS' NEEDS

(spoiler: it's a mess, although i try to contain it as much as i can)

---

project layout:

- docs/

  All of the documentation goes here. Not really concerned with
  how it's organized there.

- scripts/

  Various (mostly lifecycle) scripts. Not used in Socketeer, but
  rather, assist in doing things like testing, publishing, building,
  and so forth.

- src/

  This is where the source code lives.

  All code is written in es6, support targeting the latest LTS release (as of
  writing, v4.4.4). The code should NOT utilize any es6 features or syntax that
  is not yet supported by said LTS release. There will be a test-specific build
  that only transpiles the es6 module imports to commonjs requires, and then
  runs the test suite on the build to make sure that the code on the
  node version. Testing is done via Travis. No Appveyor, unless you want to
  make it work yourself, and then creating a PR for it. Fuck Windows.

  (Patience, my friend. Soon enough node 6 will be LTS, and you'll
  be able to use most of the es6 features.)

  The code also contains lines used for debugging. These debug lines
  are marked out by having the word `[DEBUG]` at the end. The build
  script creates the debugless files by removing all lines that are marked as
  debug lines, so NEVER MIX DEBUG AND NON-DEBUG CODE IN A SINGLE LINE.

- test/

  All test scripts. This one is a bit tricky, because I have to be as DRY as
  possible, while testing the entire suite.

  A testing script in scripts/ will run the test suite on each build, to make
  sure it all works.

  This folder is split up into the following directories:

  - protocol/

    Protocol tests. This tests client and server protocol compliance.

    - client/

      Client-side protocol testing. Some client will connect to the provided
      server, and the server will test the client's compliance.

    - server/

      Server-side protocol testing. Client will connect to a server, and the
      client will test the server's protocol compliance.

  - client/

    Client API testing.

    - common/

      Client tests that should work on both the nodejs client
      and the browser client.

    - browser/

      Browser client specific tests.

    - nodejs/

      Nodejs client specific tests.

  - server/

    Server API testing.

- _temp-build/

  The temporary build directory. Should be automatically
  removed after each build attempt.

  Purged automatically with 'npm run clean'.

- dist/

  The distribution directory, or where all of the built files are.
  The directory itself is what we use to publish Socketeer. We `cd` into
  the directory, and then run 'npm publish'.

  Purged automatically with 'npm run clean'.

- _temp/

  A temporary directory, used for any scripts that create files that make
  manual processes faster (e.g. creating .zips of the directories for the
  Github Releases tab).

  Purged automatically with 'npm run clean'.

build system:

this is what the dist directory should look like after each build:

dist/
  package.json (main -> lib/)
  LICENSE
  CHANGELOG.md
  .npmignore

  lib/          (the debugless commonjs build directory)
  debug/        (the debug commonjs build directory)

  es6/          (the debugless es6 module build directory)
  es6-debug/    (the debug es6 module build directory)

  browser/ (browser builds)
    index.js (scripts/build/browser-index.js)

    (
      [].js (unminified debugless builds)
      []-min.js (minified debugless builds)
      []-debug.js (unminified debug builds)
    )

    (
      i will eventually drop all sorts of exports until es6
      modules are mature in most popular browsers and clients

      so basically, in about ~2-6 years
    )

    (
      if the export has a name, it's named 'SocketeerBrowserClient'
    )
